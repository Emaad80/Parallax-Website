🚀 How It Works
The parallax effect is mainly achieved using CSS properties like background-attachment, background-position, and transform. A small amount of JavaScript is used to enhance the scrolling behavior and add subtle interactivity. As the user scrolls down the page, background images move slower than the content in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and immersion.
